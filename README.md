# dablenparty

## My central site. No real purpose, just a proof of concept that contains helpful links (for me, anyways)

### imgs

#### Contains all images for the site

* ##### apps
  
  Contains icons used for the grid on the Apps Page

* ##### repos
  
  Contains icons used for the grid on the GitHub page

### js

#### Contains all of the individual JavaScript files that are referenced

* ##### gridMaker.js
  
  Makes the grids found on the GitHub and Apps pages. CSS is applied independently in the stylesheet

* ##### navBar.js
  
  This is the bread and butter of the site; the script that makes the top navigation bar work properly

### old

#### Contains the old files from the previous design

### index.html

#### Rather self explanatory, the index file of the site (also contains a little JS used for adding a random video to the YouTube page)

### style.css

#### Again self explanatory, the main stylesheet for the site
