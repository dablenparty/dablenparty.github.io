		<p class="body-text">I am a student who enjoys computers, so much so that I am pursuing a career in writing code for them. My skills range far outside of just that, however; in fact, coding is my least matured skill. I am much more proficient in video and photo editing, along with playing a multitude of video games, and I create videos for both education as well as entertainment, although due to the comedic nature of the entertainment oriented videos, they will be placed on a separate page.</p>
